## A really cool tool for transferring files

### Fast
I can't verify this and it doesn't even work, but it probably is or something. I have no idea.

### Zig
Zig is maybe a plus or minus-- I'm not really sure. I only did it in Zig because I was in a created Zig folder and pushed it to GitHub. Now we find ourselves at this period in time.
Chicken is a delightful meal, in which I take great pleasure consuming.

### Chase
Chase is ok. He has a laptop that he dual boots and he knows german and stuff.
One problem is he has a metal in his last name.
Other than that it's fine.
